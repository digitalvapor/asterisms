      "#A smattering of cities to observe the sky\n",
      "I really love the night sky, but in San Francisco the night sky is sometimes more observable on the computer if you know what I mean.. you don't? It is REALLY FOGGY ALL THE TIME west of [Sutro Mountain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Sutro). Hobby-wise, I've been working on [a PySkyAlmanac fork](https://github.com/digitalvapor/PySkyAlmanac) and have primarily been testing the almanac with my own location. See [the generated San Francisco chart here](https://digitalvapor.github.io/PySkyAlmanac/). I've been making it a wee bit more 'automatic', and now want to test for a smattering of choice cities.\n",

      "[Brandon Rhodesmill](http://rhodesmill.org/brandon/) who wrote [PyEphem](https://github.com/brandon-rhodes/pyephem) has a [modest database of cities](https://github.com/brandon-rhodes/pyephem/blob/master/ephem/cities.py) that you can use when setting up an astronomical observer. See his quick reference for [settting up an observer](http://rhodesmill.org/pyephem/quick.html#body-compute-observer).\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is an example, using my home town of [Winter Springs, FL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_Springs,_Florida). Using the coordinates from [geohack](https://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Winter_Springs%2C_Florida&params=28_41_36_N_81_16_44_W_region:US_type:city) and elevation (m) from Wikipedia is a breeze, but it is ... more breezy? to just use the database as you can see for San Francisco.\n",

      "I have some criterion for testing the sky almanac. I want cities near the 40\u00b0N, 50\u00b0N, and 30\u00b0S latitudes to compare to the [Skygazers Almanac](https://www.shopatsky.com/product/skygazers-almanac-2014-40-deg-n/calendars-and-almanacs) calculated by [Roger W. Sinnott](http://www.skyandtelescope.com/about-us/roger-w-sinnott/). I also wanted some locations near the equator and arctic / antarctic circles."
