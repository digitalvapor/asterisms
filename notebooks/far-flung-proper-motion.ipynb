This particular one wound up being more of personal research on the subject and less code, because it is my first time reading about precession matrices.

Also, Brandon Rhodes wrote a great breakdown of an intrinsic limitation of the IAU precession model that is currently used by [PyEphem](http://rhodesmill.org/pyephem/) and [Skyfield](http://rhodesmill.org/skyfield/).\n",

As published, this model is valid for only ~200 years on either side of the J2000.0 epoch. This is due to round-off error in the published coefficients and truncation to a 3rd order polynomial in the expressions for the Euler rotation angles. Therefore, outside this interval, the long-term precession and obliquity model [17] of Owen is used to maintain accuracy in the calculation of apparent (\"of-date\") quantities.\n",
