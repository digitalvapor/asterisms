      "Dealing with the Hipparcos Catalog, or any other large set of data, I may want to create a mini-database just for the stars that I am going to use. An example could be for creating a map for a segment of sky. Plus, large databases are already hosted elsewhere; there is no reason for me to duplicate them. This will also make any search algorithm we use way faster. \n",

      "While doing this, I want to check the contents of the Hipparcos Catalog file for my personal use, not for validity, but whether it contains all the stars I will need. Scroll down to the bottom to see why this is a good idea.\n",

      "In the [pystaratlas](https://code.google.com/p/pystaratlas/) project, there is a [hip2.dat](https://pystaratlas.googlecode.com/files/hip2.dat) file of the [Hipparcos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hipparcos) Catalog. `hip2.dat` is [I/311](http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/Cat?cat=I%2F311) *Hipparcos, the new Reduction of the Raw data* extracted from [hip2.dat.gz](http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/vizier/ftp/cats/I/311/hip2.dat.gz). `hip2.dat` from [pystaratlas](https://code.google.com/p/pystaratlas/) has an extra line for the column headers. The code is immune to using either `hip2.dat` file, but the file at the moment is from pystaratlas. \n",

      "If you look at pystaratlas, they didn't include it in the main repo. This is because it is big. To me 32MB isn't that big by itself, but we try to keep large files out of repos. Github warns at 50MB. Also, this is *way* smaller than the original [The Hipparcos and Tycho Catalogues](http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/Cat?I/239) files. Hip2 is filtered, for what - I need to still read on, and then we filter it again. Also, see the [text download](http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/nph-Cat/txt?I%2F239), if you want just plaintext and no gzip for whatever reason."
