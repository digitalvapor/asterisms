============
Installation
============

There are a few dependencies for Asterisms. Numpy and Skyfield should be enough for the minimal inner workings. Vondrak is needed if you wish to precess any stars throughout history. Matplotlib is used with the basic cartography methods.

* `Numpy <http://www.numpy.org>`_ - ``pip install numpy``
* `Skyfield <http://rhodesmill.org/skyfield/>`_ - ``pip install skyfield``
* `Vondrak <https://digitalvapor.github.io/vondrak/>`_ - ``pip install vondrak``
* `Maplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/>`_ - ``pip install matplotlib``

If you have any problems with installation, or would like to suggest an improvement, simply create an issue on the project's Github page:
